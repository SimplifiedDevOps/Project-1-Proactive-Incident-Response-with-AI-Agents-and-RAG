## Overview

The incident response system leverages an AI agent that performs the following actions:
- Monitors critical stages within a CI/CD pipeline.
- Detects incidents and attempts automated resolutions.
- Collects operator feedback to adapt and improve the AI agent’s recommendations.

The integration utilizes a combination of tools, including Jenkins, Prometheus, Pinecone, LangChain, and an AI model, to deliver end-to-end incident response.

---

## Stages

### Stage 1: Infrastructure Setup

**Objective**: Set up the necessary infrastructure components for storing and retrieving incident data and embeddings.

1. **Deploy Pinecone Vector Database**:
   - Pinecone is configured as a vector database to store and retrieve embeddings of past incidents.
   - This allows the AI agent to find similar incidents and suggest resolutions based on historical data.

2. **Implement Prometheus for Monitoring and Alerts**:
   - Prometheus is configured to monitor application and infrastructure metrics.
   - Define alert rules (e.g., high error rates, service downtime) that trigger incidents when certain thresholds are met.

3. **Directory Structure**:
   The `incident-response` directory contains all necessary scripts and configuration files:
   ```plaintext
   └── incident-response/
       ├── config/
       ├── embeddings/
       ├── pinecone_integration/
       ├── incidents/
       ├── ai_agent/
       ├── incident_data_logger.py
       ├── incident_scheduler.py
       ├── incident_test_simulator.py

## Stage 2: AI Incident Response Agent Configuration

**Objective**: Set up the AI agent to handle incidents, retrieve similar past incidents, and suggest resolutions.

### AI Agent Setup

- **LangChain** is used to build an AI agent that processes incidents, triages them, and attempts resolution using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.
- The agent retrieves similar incidents from **Pinecone** and uses prompt templates to ensure consistency in data collection and recommendations.

### Memory Configuration

- **LangChain’s `ConversationBufferMemory`** is configured to retain incident history, allowing the agent to provide context-based follow-up on unresolved incidents.
- **Prompt templates** are used to ensure the AI agent consistently requests relevant information from operators during incident reporting.

---

## Stage 3: Integrating Incident Response with CI/CD

**Objective**: Integrate incident response and monitoring into the CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins.

### Jenkins Pipeline Integration

- Add a new `Jenkinsfile` or modify the existing one to monitor critical stages like `build`, `test`, and `deploy`.
- If an incident occurs during these stages, the pipeline automatically sends an alert to the AI agent and attempts an automated resolution.

### Simulated Failure Testing

- A dedicated Jenkinsfile (`Jenkinsfile_test`) simulates a failure to validate the incident response workflow and ensure it properly interacts with the AI agent.

### Code Example

Here’s a simplified view of the Jenkins pipeline code for monitoring and sending alerts:

```groovy
stage('Monitor for Incidents') {
    steps {
        script {
            def incidentDetected = checkForIncident()
            if (incidentDetected) {
                sendIncidentAlertAndResolution("Deployment failure")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Stage 4: Automating Incident Data Collection and RAG Embedding

**Objective**: Automate the process of logging incident data, generating embeddings, and storing them in Pinecone.

### Incident Data Logging

- `incident_data_logger.py` captures details from each incident (e.g., root cause, resolution steps) and generates embeddings.
- These embeddings are stored in **Pinecone**, allowing the AI agent to retrieve them for similar future incidents.

### Scheduling Incident Embedding Updates

- `incident_scheduler.py` runs at regular intervals (e.g., daily) to ensure Pinecone’s database is updated with recent incidents, enhancing retrieval accuracy.
- Alternatively, use a **cron job** to run the scheduler at specified intervals.

### Code Example

Here’s an example of how the scheduler is set to run every 24 hours:

```python
schedule.every(24).hours.do(update_pinecone_with_recent_incidents)
while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
```

## Stage 5: Testing and Continuous Learning

**Objective**: Implement end-to-end testing and a feedback loop for adaptive learning.

### Testing the Incident Response Workflow

- **`incident_test_simulator.py`** simulates common incidents to verify that the AI agent retrieves relevant past incidents and suggests appropriate resolutions.
- **Prometheus alerts** and **Jenkins pipeline failures** are also tested to confirm that they successfully trigger the AI agent as expected.

### Enable Feedback Loop for Continuous Improvement

- The Jenkins pipeline includes an **Operator Feedback** stage that prompts operators to rate and provide feedback on the AI agent’s resolution.
- This feedback is stored in a JSON file for continuous learning, and periodic analysis helps refine the AI agent’s retrieval algorithms and prompt templates.

### Code Example

Below is an example of the **Operator Feedback** stage in the Jenkins pipeline:

```groovy
stage('Operator Feedback') {
    steps {
        script {
            def feedbackResponse = input(message: 'Provide feedback:', parameters: [
                string(name: 'feedbackText', description: 'Feedback here'),
                choice(name: 'rating', choices: '1\n2\n3\n4\n5')
            ])
            sendFeedbackToAgent("incident_id", feedbackResponse['feedbackText'], feedbackResponse['rating'])
        }
    }
}
```

## Feedback Loop for Continuous Improvement

### Feedback Collection

- **Operators provide feedback** through Jenkins on the AI agent’s incident resolution effectiveness.
- Feedback includes **text comments** and a **rating (1 to 5)** on the resolution’s quality.

### Adaptive Learning

- Feedback data is stored in `feedback_log.json`, which is periodically analyzed to improve prompt templates, retrieval algorithms, or response logic.
- Future versions of the AI agent may incorporate **feedback-driven refinements** to enhance recommendation accuracy.

---

## Deployment and Testing

### Deployment

- Deploy all necessary components, including **Pinecone**, **Prometheus**, and **Jenkins**, as per the configuration in each stage.
- Use **Docker** or a cloud platform (e.g., **AWS**) for containerized deployment if needed.

### Testing

1. Run `incident_test_simulator.py` to **simulate incidents** and observe the AI agent’s responses.
2. Trigger alerts in **Prometheus** and **failure stages in Jenkins** to verify the full incident response workflow.

### End-to-End Verification

- **Check the feedback loop** by submitting ratings and feedback to ensure it reaches the AI agent and is stored correctly.

## Future Improvements

1. **Real-Time Adaptive Learning**:
   - Integrate **machine learning models** to analyze feedback data and make real-time adjustments to the agent’s retrieval algorithm.

2. **Enhanced Feedback Mechanism**:
   - Use a **web-based interface** or **Slack integration** for operators to submit feedback and review past incidents more interactively.

3. **Advanced Incident Analysis**:
   - Implement **clustering algorithms** to group similar incidents and identify patterns in frequent issues, aiding in proactive incident prevention.
